# Application-of-Linear-Logistic-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Naive-Bayes-in-the-data-sets
It includes the task of loading different data sets and then performing following ML algos in the data sets
First of all the data sets are read through importing pandas library with pd.read_csv
Then following ML algos are used like
                                     1)Linear Regression
                                     2)Logistic Regression
                                     3)Decision Tree
                                     4)Random Forest
                                     5)Naive Bayes

For this two data sets are used
